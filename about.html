    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>DelveHomes was founded in 1969 by Dan Homes on the basis of organized housing for all persons. After a rough start with next to no one being interested in the project, he was finally approached by a small group of engineers who heard of his ideals and were willing to help. In 1973, the new team started working on what would become DelveHomes Machine-operated housing units.</p>

    <h2>Tech</h2>
    <p>DelveHomes housing units are all connected to a central computer that controls each and every module of each and every room. Not only does it define the capabilities of the amenities in the rooms, but it also lets those in the room communicate and travel between other rooms. For more information on the amenities present in the rooms, see here</p>
