    <p>The Machine offers a care-free lifestyle supplied by assistive technologies present in each accommodation, experiences provided by The Machine, convenient product delivery, unique airship travel, and methods of traversal across the surface.</p>
    <p>Every room is lighted neither by window nor by lamp, yet it is filled with a soft radiance. There are no apertures for ventilation, yet the air is fresh. There are no musical instruments, and yet, at the moment that the mediation opens, the room is throbbing with melodious sounds.</p>
    <p>In each and every home of The Machine, there are electric buttons that call for food, for music, for clothing. There's a hot bath button, by pressure of which a basin of (imitation) marble rose out of the floor, filled to the brim with a warm deodorized liquid. There's a cold-bath button. There's a button that produces literature, and of course buttons by which to communicate with others. The room contains little more.</p>
