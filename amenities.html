                <h2>Airships</h2>
                <p>To visit other sectors, one may open a tunnel with a button specified in the Book and ride in the car within it to the lift station, in which resides the airships.</p>
                <p>The airships themselves are vast, without most of the technologies of the rooms. The furniture and decorations are less advanced, and instead of the buttons one will have a human assistant onboard the ships. There is a revolving platform which lowers guests to their individual rooms, with glass valves marking entryways.</p>

                    <p>Every room is lighted neither by window nor by lamp, yet it is filled with a soft radiance. There are no apertures for ventilation, yet the air is fresh. There are no musical instruments, and yet, at the moment that the mediation opens, the room is throbbing with melodious sounds.</p>

                    <p>In each and every home of The Machine, there are electric buttons that call for food, for music, for clothing. There's a hot bath button, by pressure of which a basin of (imitation) marble rose out of the floor, filled to the brim with a warm deodorized liquid. There's a cold-bath button. There's a button that produces literature, and of course buttons by which to communicate with others. The room contains little more.</p>
